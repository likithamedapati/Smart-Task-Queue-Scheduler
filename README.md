🧾 Smart Task Queue Scheduler

A Python-based task scheduling simulator that demonstrates the Queue (FIFO) data structure through a real-world task processing system.

This project simulates how operating systems and service systems manage tasks in order of arrival.

🚀 Features

Add tasks to queue (enqueue)

Process next task (dequeue)

View next task (peek)

Display waiting tasks in order

Cancel specific task

Clear entire queue safely

Completed task history

Timestamp tracking for finished tasks

Motivation messages after processing

Interactive menu system

🧠 Concepts Used

Queue (FIFO data structure)

Lists in Python

Dictionary for tracking timestamps

Loops & conditionals

User input handling

System simulation logic
